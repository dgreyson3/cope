Here's your fixed code. I kinda restarted in the Battleship main seeing as there were 14 errors. 
I purposefully didn't optimize everything for three reasons.
  - So you can optimize it and learn
  - So it doesn't look too much like my code
  - im lazy (sorry)
Everything works and just needs to be made better. Heres a list of things you can fix:
  - Make it so when the user inputs data, in battleship class, the program cannot break. 
  - Make it so when the computer puts in data it cant break
  - Make it so ships cant overlap
  - Make sure nothing can break!


Hope this helps!
(Also if i were you i would save your current code somewhere in case i changed something you didnt like)
You'll need to just copy and paste each class, I added a little bit to everything. In certain areas you were missing super important stuff(not your fault it looks like aloi had you paste half of some code, leaving out some important things.)
